This software is mainly used to analyze the parameter information of acupuncture manipulation (AM) derived from the three-dimensional motion tracking system (Simi Motion Ver.8.5). Kinematic parameters of six finger joints can be analyzed by this software during the periodic AM (lifting-thrusting and twirling), and caculate the average velocity, amplitude, operation cycle, frequency, etc. along the X/Y/Z-axis of each joint in the three-dimensional space, so as to complete the quantitative evaluation of the basic AM.
